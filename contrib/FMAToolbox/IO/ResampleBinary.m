function ResampleBinary(inputName,outputName,nChannels,up,down)

%ResampleBinary - Resample binary data file.
%
% Resample binary data file, e.g. create LFP file from raw data file.
%
%  USAGE
%
%    ResampleBinary(inputName,outputName,nChannels,up,down)
%
%    inputName      binary input file
%    outputName     binary output file
%    nChannels      number of channels in the file
%    up             upsampling integer factor
%    down           downsampling integer factor
%
%  NOTE
%
%    The actual resampling ratio is up/down.
%
%    Here is a list of typical values for Spike2 recording systems:
