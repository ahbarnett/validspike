This is Patwary's original distribution directory
dbscan-v1.0.0/parallel_multicore/
including its original Makefile and README.

I have added one MATLAB code dbscanpatwaryexec.m which calls
the executable omp_dbscan using temporary files for I/O.
This is pending a MEX interface, which seems hard to do since
Patwary's code is not cleanly accessible as a library call.
